# Rules

## Your first project is to build a showcase website. Your website should:

- Tell us about you
- Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what you’ve learnt so far
- Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript ✅
- Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes) ✅
- Be hosted on GitHub Pages ✅
- Link back to the GitHub repo with the code for your website

This is a very open ended project. We really welcome your creativity in this it’s your opportunity to show off with a website about you!
